        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://whitewater.org/">WhiteWaterCenter</a></h3>
            <p>White Water is a whitewater rafting center.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast:This site has a lot of contrast. The white nav bar text is white with a black background at the top of the screen. When scrolling down, over the water, where the white text would not contrast well, a background appears and the white text turns black so that it can be visibly seen.  </li>
                <li>Repetition: Consistent use of fonts in the nav bar. Image sizing is all correct and matches up as well. </li>
                <li>Alignment: Everything is aligned. Tiles for images are aligned as well. Nav bar isn't center but it works well.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Images are grouped together in rows. Single images are at the top of the page. Text associates with the appropriate images. Text regarding anything more in depth, like contact info, company info, etc. are hidden within nav bar elements at the bottom of the page that redirects the user. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>White Water's website appears to work smoothly and load high resolution images well. They also do not overcrowd the user with too much information on their home page.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
            <p>Craigslist is an older website for buying and selling things/services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: This website does not struggle with contrast issues. Background colors are either a very light gray or white. Text is either the standard hyperlink blue color or black.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Consistent use of fonts in the nav bar. All of the columns are structured similarly.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Website is essentially a large table that sits on the middle of the screen for a user. Whitespace on right and left sides. Text is all centered and aligned.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Appropriate categories hold appriate items inside of columns that are spaced out approrpiately. Locations are in a separate column, divided away from cateogries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Craigslist has a very outdated, old website that is somewhat functional. In short, it gets the job done.</p>
